# Inspiration:

As nowadays many people are going through depression and stress and they need someone whom they can talk and share their thoughts. So we made this platform where they can freely write about themselves and save their memories and store them for future reference. Apart from that they can also save any image and video of them too. Basically this project is based on someone's healthcare by providing them with a companion whom they can trust.

# The problem it solves:
 
1)Reduce depression and stress.
2)More secure place to save the memories.
3)Memories can be stored with a proper arrangement.
4)Improve mental health.
